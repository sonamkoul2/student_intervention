# Project 2: Supervised Learning
## Building a Student Intervention System

- The goal of this project is to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their High School final exam, by constructing an intervention system that leverages supervised learning techniques.

- The purpose of this project is to get familiar with using ` Supervised Machine Learning techinques`
- I Analysed a dataset on students' performance and developed a cost effective model that will predict the likelihood that a given student will pass, quantifying whether an intervention is necessary.
- After reading this project, you should know how to uncover patterns from data to group them into categories 

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

Udacity recommends our students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), i pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 



### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `student_intervention/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

`ipython notebook student_intervention.ipynb`  
`jupyter notebook student_intervention.ipynb`

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is included as `student-data.csv`.
