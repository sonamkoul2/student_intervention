    "**Answer: **\n",
    "   Three supervised learning models that are appropriate for this problem are: Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes Classifiers.\n",
    "   According to Udacity,  desicion trees are trees that classify instances by sorting them based on feature values. Instances are classified starting at the root node and sorted based on their feature values.\n",
    "   Decision tree models are in general used in computer vision, robotics, control systems, video games and medical analysis. They describe how to switch between a finite set of tasks in a modular fashion. \n",
    "   Even though the divide-and-conquer algorithm is quick and efficient, it can become important in tasks with hundreds of thousands of instances. The most timeconsuming aspect is sorting the instances on a numeric feature to find the best threshold t. This can be expedited if possible thresholds for a numeric feature are determined just once, effectively converting the feature to discrete intervals, or if the threshold is determined from a subset of the instances. Elomaa & Rousu (1999) stated that the use of binary discretization with C4.5 needs about the half training time of using C4.5 multisplitting. In addition, according to their experiments, multi-splitting of numerical features does not carry any advantage in prediction accuracy over binary splitting. Decision trees are usually univariate since they use splits based on a single feature at each internal node. However, there are a few methods that construct multivariate trees. One example is Zheng’s (1998), who improved the classification accuracy of the decision trees by constructing new binary features with logical operators such as conjunction, negation, and disjunction. In addition, Zheng (2000) created at-least Mof-N features. Decision trees can be significantly more complex representation for some concepts due to the replication problem. A solution is using an algorithm to implement complex features at nodes in order to avoid replication. Markovitch and Rosenstein (2002) presented the FICUS construction algorithm, which receives the standard input of supervised learning as well as a feature representation specification, and uses them to produce a set of generated features.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   SVM methods are generally used in Bioinformatic, astroparticle physics, vehicles and photo processing industry.  \n",
    "Limitation of SVMs is the low speed of the training. Selecting kernel settings can be regarded in a similar way to choosing the number of hidden nodes in a neural network. As long as the kernel function is legitimate, a SVM will operate correctly even if the designer does not know exactly what features of the training data are being used in the kernel-induced transformed feature space.\n",
    "According to Garreta, Raúl, and Moncecchi, Guillermo, Learning scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python, Support Vector machine (SVM) has become one of the state-of-the-art machine learning models for many tasks with excellent results in many practical applications, one of the greatest advantages of SVM is that they are very effective when working on high-dimensional spaces, that is, on problems which have a lot of features to learn from. They are also very effective when the data is sparse (think about a high-dimensional space with very few instances). Besides, they are very efficient in terms of memory storage, since only a subset of the points in the learning space is used to represent the decision surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Naive Bayesian Networks, such as Multinomial NB, are used in text classification, word processing, in business analysis and marketing, where the data are typically represented as word vector counts. \n",
    "Naive Bayesian networks (NB) are very simple Bayesian networks which are composed of directed acyclic graphs with only one parent (representing the unobserved node) and several children (corresponding to observed nodes) with a strong assumption of independence among child nodes in the context of their parent (Good, 1950).Thus, the independence model (Naive Bayes) is based on estimating (Nilsson, 1965). Typically, the task of learning a Bayesian network can be divided into two subtasks: initially, the learning of the DAG structure of the network, and then the determination of its parameters. In spite of the remarkable power of Bayesian Networks, they have an inherent limitation. This is the computational difficulty of exploring a previously unknown network.\n",
    "   Knowing that data in this project is relatively small and imbalanced(265 passed and 130 failed out of 395 students), I used Stratified Shuffle Split(sss) to take care of that imbalanced quality of data, because sss makes sure that the training and testing sets have about equal ratio of passed vs. failed students. It also removes the bias that ordering of students might have in the datasets. I chose the above three models because they perform well with small data, using less processing time and memory storage. I wouldn't have chosen SVM if stratified shuffle split was not able to take care of the umbalance quality of data because, SVM performs poorly with umbalance data. Multinomial Naive Bayes, SVM and Multivariate trees are also known to perform well on data with many features like ours in this project. Therefore, I chose them to be applied in this project.       "

    "This model is a type of seperator that classify a given element into either one of two or more given groups.\n",
    "For this classifier to accurately do this task, it first learns from some similar elements with similar characteristics (called features) and from the groups those elements belong (called targets). It then draws a frontier between those groups of elements. That frontier called margin, can be a wide or small space, a curve, or a single line between the two groups. Let's take an example of a wedding at which all guests invited by the groom were asked to come to the wedding in black suits, red ties, and white hats just like the groom himself was dressed. The ones invited by the bride were to come to the wedding in white suits, blue ties, black hats just like the bride. The wedding hall had two sets of seats, one set on the right where the  groom was sitting, and the other set of seats on the left where the bride was, seperated by a wide and long hallway. The receptionist was asked to assign seats to the guests according to the way they are dressed, such that those dressed like the groom seat at the groom side and those dressed like the bride also seat at the bride side. Therefore, the groom and the bride are training sets. As the receptionist were to see guests driving into the parking lot, even without asking the guests, can immediately know whether they are present at the invitation of the groom or the bride just like this model knowing a given student's likelihood of passing or failing the final before the exam.       \n",
    "I have chosen this model because it can quickly predict early enough whether or not a given student should have additional help to graduate with less resouces and cost. Knowing the conditions surrounding the student, this model can predict in less than a second how well or poorly a student's final results may be without any additional assistance. This model will save you money and time for you to invest more robust intervention system necessary to help students who will be predicted to fail the final.    "
